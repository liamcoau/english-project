									Frederick Douglass, who became an orator, writer, statesman, and diplomat, began life as a slave on a Maryland plantation. While he was still a baby, he was separated from his mother. He never knew his exact age. His strength of character surfaced early. Though he was denied formal education, Douglass taught himself to read and write. In 1838 he escaped to New York and then to New Bedford, Massachusetts.

									<p class="list-group-item-text"><b>What excuse does Master Thomas give for not sheltering Douglass from Mr. Covey?</b></p>
								</a>
								
								<div class="list-group-item">
									<p class="list-group-item-text">Answer: Master Thomas ridicules the idea of there being any danger of Mr. Covey killing Douglass; he says he knows Mr. Covey and that he is a good man whom Mr. Thomas could not think of taking Douglass from; he says that he would lose a whole year's wages.</p>

									<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">Question 1:</h3>
									<p class="list-group-item-text"><b>What drives Douglass to the extreme of running away to seek the protection of his master?</b></p>
								</a>
								
								<div class="list-group-item">
									<p class="list-group-item-text">Answer: The work was too hard for him, to the point where he was unable to continue. Mr. Covey brutally beat Douglass for not working even though he isn't able to, leaving a large bleeding wound on his head. This builds up hatred for Mr. Covey, and his desperation. The situation for the exhausted and battered Douglass is dire, and the only place he can turn to is the pity of his master. He hopes that his master will pity him because he is being so viciously treated and will protect him by sending him to a new home.</p>

									<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">Question 2:</h3>
									<p class="list-group-item-text"><b>Why does Sandy Jenkins encourage Douglass to go back?</b></p>
								</a>
								
								<div class="list-group-item">
									<p class="list-group-item-text">Answer: Though Douglass may have hopes of escaping on his mind, Sandy Jenkins is an "old advisor" and seems to be down to earth and not a high optimist. He knows that there is not a good chance of escaping, and it is most likely going to result in Douglass' heavy punishment or death. Given that Sandy Jenkins has presumably been a slave his entire life and seems to be in a more comfortable position, being able to visit wife whom is a free black woman, it is justified to think that he is not particularly interested in the endeavour of escaping slavery. Because of his own circumstances, he would be less likely to encourage others to try to escape. Sandy Jenkins encourages Douglass to go back even if he has to suffer the consequences, because he believes it will be safer or better for Douglass than attempting to escape. Sandy Jenkins also tells Douglass about the root, which he can carry with him for protection. He could believe that Douglass will not be harmed again if he goes back with this root.</p>

									<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">Question 3:</h3>
									<p class="list-group-item-text"><b>Why would sending Douglass to the public whipping post be destructive to Mr. Covey's reputation?</b></p>
								</a>
								
								<div class="list-group-item">
									<p class="list-group-item-text">Answer: If Mr. Covey were to have Douglass taken to the public whipping post, it would show to the public that Mr. Covey was unable to control a boy only sixteen years old. Being publicly whipped for the crime of raising his hand against a white man would show everyone that Douglass managed to rebel against Mr. Covey. This would stain Mr. Covey's "unbounded" reputation as an overseer and negro-breaker.</p>
